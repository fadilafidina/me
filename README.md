# me!

this repo's me trying to build a portfolio/landing page for myself :)

i'm using nextjs, tailwind css, react + vercel to deploy :D

it's a constant wip, but here's the temporary url - https://me-fadilafidina.vercel.app/

i hope this inspires you to build your own site and to have fun!

## to start the app locally

`yarn next run`

## to build

`yarn build`

## to deploy to 'prod'

push to master
